This is going to sell out quickly so get your tickets now!\nPetra, one of the most popular and influential bands in Christian music history, who retired from touring in 2005, is doing a limited run of tour dates to celebrate 50 years as a band. Whether they were the band you grew up with, or you just discovered them you will not want to miss this concert.\nIt is rare for any artist to last 50 years, but for a band who has released 24 albums over their illustrious career, sold over 10 million records, garnered four Grammys, ten Doves, an induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame - it’s relatively unheard of.\nPetra will be playing hits from their 50-year history as well as reminiscing about changes in the culture, the church and Christian music. Come join us and be a part of Christian music history!\nAssigned seating floor and balcony and Backstage tickets are available!  (Backstage Tickets include front and center seating  plus a backstage meet and greet with the bands before the concert)\nSpecial Guest: REVIVAL",

Giuliano Rascan and Dejan Zoric’s collaboration merges the gap between tech, bass, and pop genres to curate house that is undeniably rooted in West Coast influence.\nWhile the standard house rules apply, No Thanks lures their listeners into an auditory playground that is vocal driven and stylized with high pitch, tight drums, and low bass lines. Their approach to music is instrumentally nuanced, but their philosophy is simple: there’s something for everyone. This duo’s international reach has generated a global call for West Coast house, and No Thanks is responding.\nLatest release \"Freak\" dropped just under 3 weeks ago and has already hit 300k streams and a number of big Spotify playlists.\nHighlights include DJ support from Marten Horger, DJ Susan, Neon Steve, Dr Fresch, Wax Motif, Chris Lake, Biscits, David Guetta, CID, BIJOU, Tiesto, FREAK ON, Westend, Loud Luxury, Bingo Players, ACRAZE, Kyle Watson, 3lau and more!\n.",
